# BinarySearchTree
A test implementation of a binary search tree
This was a test implementation and the code was not tested. 
There are different type of binary trees and they are quite different. This codes was trying to implement a binary search tree(nodes values on root's left side are less than the root-node's value; nodes value on root-node's right side are greater than root's value).
