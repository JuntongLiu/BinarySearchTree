# BinarySearchTree
A test implementation of a binary search tree.
This is a test implementation and the code has not been tested. 
There are different type of binary trees, and they are quite different. This codes implement a binary search tree (nodes values on root's left side are less than the root-node's value; nodes value on root-node's right side are greater than root's value).
